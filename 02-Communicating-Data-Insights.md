## Communicating information

It is important to understand how we share knowledge and insights, by first understanding how we communicate with each other.

---

### How we communicate

#### :red_circle: Written communication

Strong written communication skills relies on two key concepts:

- Utilize appropriate format
  - Consider the communication method
  - Maintain expectations
  - Anticipate audience needs
- Being concise
  - Create a clear focus
  - Incorporate supporting concepts
  - Find the balance

Examples: *Emails, Reports, Proposals, Blog posts*

#### :red_circle: Visual communication

It is the easiest format to consume and can hit a much wider audience. Success relies on the same key concepts of conciseness and format, but does it a bit differently:

- Format and simplicity blend together
- Expansive guidelines for creating the right visual

Examples: *Charts, graphs, pictures, videos*

#### :red_circle: Verbal communication

Keys to verbal success are more straightforward than the others:

- Focuses on tone and consistency
- Flexibility and responsiveness are difference makers
- Respond directly to audience needs

Examples: *Phone and videos calls, face-to-face conversations*

#### :red_circle: Non-verbal communication

The main avenue for gathering feedback during verbal communication is from nonverbal communication. It illustrates how well a message is performing and if your audience is engaged.

Example: *Posture, eye contact, facial expressions, gestures*

### Data insights

***Insight*** is a deep understanding of a business issue or situation to uncover value.

#### :red_circle: Obtaining insights

The process involves:

- collecting data on a business problem,
- organizing it,
- applying analytical techniques,
- deriving actionable insights,
- communicating them, and
- observing outcomes.

#### :red_circle: Insights in action

Insights can drive various business decisions, such as:

- determining product mix
- minimizing risk
- optimizing resources
- understanding supply chain disruptions

Even minor insights are valuable.

#### :red_circle: Uncovering insights

A few best practices to keep in mind to make communicating insights seamless:

- tie insights back to common business objectives for better context,
- ensure the audience gets enough supporting information to understand the scope of your findings,
- simplicity is essential so break complex insights into smaller ideas.

---

### Getting to know your audience

Understanding the audience is the most important part of communicating and to anticipate their needs, you should:

- understand the audience's expected format,
- tailor the message based on your audience's feedback,
- keep the messaging simple, and
- utilize context to enhance value.

Get into the mindset of your audience by asking questions, such as:

- What roles does your audience have?
- What does your audience already know?
- What does your audience need to know?
- How well does your audience know you?

Build a plan to communicate:

- ***Obtain insights:*** What key findings did your insights uncover?
- ***Identify stakeholders:*** Tailor your communication to your stakeholders
- ***Importance of roles:*** Understanding stakeholders' roles can help your prepare effective interactions
- ***Need to know:*** Ensures each stakeholder gets relevant information without being overwhelmed
- ***Learn from the past:*** Reflect on past interactions to adjust communication strategies

## Effective data visuals

Visualizations make complex information more accessible and uncover insights. Visualization are at the forefront of communicating data insights with charts and graphs simplifying the vast amount of information generated daily. Visualizations provide an aggregated, or summarized view of the data, that makes it easier to see overall trends and patterns.

Visualization can reduce the amount of complexity in a dataset. Simplifying complex datasets allows for a multitude of positive effects:

- faster decision making
- better decision making
- wider appeal to decision makers
- shows a more complete picture than simple aggregations

---

### Basic visualization

#### :red_circle: Bar chart

The graphical representation of *categorical data* using rectangular bars where the length of each bar is proportional to the value they represent.

#### :red_circle: Histogram

The graphical representation of data where data is grouped into continuous *number ranges* and each range corresponds to a vertical bar. This images indicates the difference between a bar chart and a histogram:

![Bar charts vs Histogram](/images/bar-chart-vs-histogram.png 'Bar charts vs Histogram')

#### :red_circle: Scatter plot

The graphical representation of data where points are plotted based on their values along vertical and horizontal axes, making it easier to detect relationships between variables. Below you will see how you can detect relationships between variables using a scatter plot:

![Scatter plot](/images/scatterplot.png 'Scatter plot')

---

### Advanced visuals

Basic bar charts limit the display to one category at a time.

#### :red_circle: Stacked bar chart

Allows a more detailed comparisons by adding a second categorical variable. This combined graph shows different income source breakdowns for each museum, providing insights such as the contemporary art museum's higher gift shop revenue compared to ticket sales:

![Standard stacked bar chart](/images/bar-chart-stacked-standard.png 'Standard stacked bar chart')

#### :red_circle: Percentage stacked bar chart

Provides different insights than a standard stacked bar chart. Here a stacked bar chart compares the percentage of total income each sales source represents for each museum, offering a clearer perspective on under or over-performing areas:

![Percentage stacked bar chart](/images/bar-chart-stacked-percentage.png 'Percentage stacked bar chart')

Flexibility in data visualization is crucial. Stacked bar charts provide comparative insights, while other visualizations can highlight different aspects. Exploring various methods can reveal new and interesting data insights.

### Guiding principles of visualization

Visualizations aid in data flow and insights in many different ways. Visualizations aim to share general information that can be quickly understood and action taken. Overall trend information is more important than knowing the exact details when constructing a Visual.

Trying to be too specific is a common issue with visualizations. Visualizations are meant to show some information, but not all information about a dataset. Keep it simple and:

- don't try to do too much in a visualization,
- aim for simplicity over complexity, abd
- use complex formats sparingly.

Create better visuals with minimal effort by removing unnecessary elements like:

- grid-lines,
- busy color schemes, and
- 3D effects.

Simplifying visual elements can improve interaction and understanding of data. Visualizations should align with audience expectations and organizational communication standards for better reception and effectiveness.

## Storytelling with data

***Data storytelling*** is a method of communicating data insights tailored to a specific audience with an overarching narrative. It is a powerful tool for communicating data insights. In the image below, the same data is visualized with storytelling on the left and without storytelling on the right to indicate the difference:

![Pie Chart vs Bar Chart](/images/storytelling-pie-vs-bar.png 'Pie Chart vs Bar Chart')

| Left - Bar Chart | Right - Pie Chart |
| --- | --- |
| ***WITH storytelling*** | ***WITHOUT storytelling*** |
| Combining robust visualizations with narrative context creates a more potent and understandable message than standalone visuals | Very hard to parse and gain any helpful information, the overall impact is hard to understand |

---

### Why tell data stories?

Data stories are:

- easier to understand,
- inspire action better, and
- your audience retains the information much longer.

They pair visualizations with narrative and context, making them accessible to a wider audience. This drives engagement and persuade better than raw data. As they are more memorable than standalone data, another benefit is being more sticky than other forms of communication.

### Keys to a good story

| Element | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ***Visualization*** | Sharing data insights in an easily understood format |
| ***Context*** | Providing the broader picture and grounding the audience's understanding |
| ***Narrative*** | Giving a voice to the data, explaining its significance, and inspiring action |

Reflecting on the bar chart visualization above with storytelling, it is clear that the small paragraph contains both our narrative and context for the insights. Combining visualization, context, and narrative makes data stories more understandable and impactful, moving from confusing visuals to clear insights.

---

### Storytelling in action

We can use a two-step process to develop stories:

1. What are we trying to say?
2. What visualization is best to share our message?

For example, if our focus is the difference between us and our competitors, a diverging bar chart would be a great choice for a visualization such as this one:

![Basic Diverging Bar Chart](/images/bar-chart-diverging-basic.png 'Basic Diverging Bar Chart')

We can take it to the next level by adding context, using colors intentionally, and simplifying visual elements to enhance the data story. These principles make the story more engaging and versatile for different presentations as illustrated below:

![Level Up Diverging Bar Chart](/images/bar-chart-diverging-level-up.png 'Level Up Diverging Bar Chart')

---

### Group framework

Developing data storytelling skills is best done as part of a team, leveraging individual strengths and the organization's data culture. Data storytelling involves three key components within four typical roles:

| Role | Responsibility | Objective |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ***Subject matter expert (SME)*** | Knowing the business problem completely | Develop narrative, build context and relate data story to organizational efforts |
| ***Visualizer*** | Blends art and science to create compelling visuals | Craft visuals that ensures insights are properly showcased |
| ***Analyst*** | Technical expert in charge of uncovering and supporting insights | Support the other roles by answering analytical questions and do not require business expertise |
| ***Reviewer*** | Evaluates the overall data story | Verifies assumptions, acts as a sample audience to give overall impression of data story |

People can serve multiple roles, and flexibility is key. A comfortable team dynamic and role rotation are more valuable than rigidly following a checklist.
