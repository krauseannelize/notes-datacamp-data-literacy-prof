## Communicating information

It is important to understand how we share knowledge and insights, by first understanding how we communicate with each other.

### How we communicate

#### :red_circle: Written communication

Strong written communication skills relies on two key concepts:

- Utilize appropriate format
  - Consider the communication method
  - Maintain expectations
  - Anticipate audience needs
- Being concise
  - Create a clear focus
  - Incorporate supporting concepts
  - Find the balance

Examples: *Emails, Reports, Proposals, Blog posts*

#### :red_circle: Visual communication

It is the easiest format to consume and can hit a much wider audience. Success relies on the same key concepts of conciseness and format, but does it a bit differently:

- Format and simplicity blend together
- Expansive guidelines for creating the right visual

Examples: *Charts, graphs, pictures, videos*

#### :red_circle: Verbal communication

Keys to verbal success are more straightforward than the others:

- Focuses on tone and consistency
- Flexibility and responsiveness are difference makers
- Respond directly to audience needs

Examples: *Phone and videos calls, face-to-face conversations*

#### :red_circle: Non-verbal communication

The main avenue for gathering feedback during verbal communication is from nonverbal communication. It illustrates how well a message is performing and if your audience is engaged.

Example: *Posture, eye contact, facial expressions, gestures*

### Getting to know your audience

Understanding the audience is the most important part of communicating and to anticipate their needs, you should:

- understand the audience's expected format,
- tailor the message based on your audience's feedback,
- keep the messaging simple, and
- utilize context to enhance value.

Get into the mindset of your audience by asking questions, such as:

- What roles does your audience have?
- What does your audience already know?
- What does your audience need to know?
- How well does your audience know you?

Build a plan to communicate:

- ***Obtain insights:*** What key findings did your insights uncover?
- ***Identify stakeholders:*** Tailor your communication to your stakeholders
- ***Importance of roles:*** Understanding stakeholders' roles can help your prepare effective interactions
- ***Need to know:*** Ensures each stakeholder gets relevant information without being overwhelmed
- ***Learn from the past:*** Reflect on past interactions to adjust communication strategies
