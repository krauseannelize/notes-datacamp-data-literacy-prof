Your will find data everywhere and there are two main formats of data:

- ***Structured data:*** Easy to manage, and mainly in a tabular format. It has a predefined structure and commonly consists of text and numbers. Customer information and financial transactions are typical examples of structured data.
- ***Unstructured data:*** Unorganized and can be difficult to manage. It has no specific format or predefined structure and may contain text, images, audio, and/or video.

Another important aspect of data is whether it is:

- ***Quantitative:*** Numerical data because we can count, measure, and express it with numbers.
- ***Qualitative:*** Categorical data because we can group it into categories.

Context is crucial for data to have meaning. ***Data context*** refers to the information that provides meaning to data, also called the metadata. It includes the characteristics of the data, such as the time frame in which it was collected, or its location and source.

### The value of data
